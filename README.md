# Fech Instagram Comments

Use this script for fetching IG comments from a specific post.

this script uses selenium and simpleaudio, so you must install them first. I recommand pip to instalation.
After that, eddit FetchComment.py and enter your specific link and username and password. then run the code using python3 and enjoy!
